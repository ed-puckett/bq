        These help files are intended to be located in a fixed relative location
        from the dist directory on the server on which they reside, and the
        bootstrap code is loaded from a relative url.  This makes the help files
        independent of the server on which they are actually located.
        The top-level help directory is at the same level as the dist directory.
