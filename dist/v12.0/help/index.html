# bq help

***(sorry, this document a barely-started work in progress)***

*bq* is a versatile notebook that can become a variety of things: a web page, a report, a technical document or even an interactive application!

All this within a Web-standards-based platform.

See the source code here: https://github.com/ed-puckett/bq

### Goals
- zero install
- portable
- durable
- typeset mathematics and other technical markup
- programmatic content
- standalone documents (with static server)
